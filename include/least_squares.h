/**
 * Solve ordinary least squares regression using QR decomposition.
 *
 * Solves the linear regression problem: min ||y - X*beta||^2
 * where X is the design matrix and y is the response vector.
 *
 * Uses QR decomposition with Householder reflections for numerical stability.
 * This method is more numerically stable than normal equations, especially
 * for ill-conditioned matrices.
 *
 * @param X Design matrix in column-major order (n x p), where n is the number
 *          of observations and p is the number of predictors. Must be non-NULL.
 * @param y Response vector (n x 1). Must be non-NULL.
 * @param n Number of observations. Must be > 0 and >= p.
 * @param p Number of predictors. Must be > 0.
 * @param beta Output: regression coefficients (p x 1). Must be pre-allocated
 *             by caller with size >= p. Must be non-NULL.
 * @return 0 on success
 *         -1 if any pointer is NULL
 *         -2 if n <= 0 or p <= 0 or n < p
 *         -3 if matrix is rank deficient or QR decomposition fails
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n*p^2)
 * Space complexity: O(n*p) (modifies X in-place, allocates O(n+p) temp space)
 * Thread safety: Thread-safe if inputs are not shared across threads
 *
 * @note The input matrix X is modified during computation (used as workspace).
 *       If you need to preserve X, pass a copy.
 * @note This function performs heap allocation for workspace. For better performance
 *       in hot paths, use fc_optim_least_squares_work() with caller-provided workspace.

 *
