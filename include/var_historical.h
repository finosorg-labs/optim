/**
 * @brief Calculate historical simulation VaR/CVaR from return series
 *
 * Computes VaR and CVaR from historical return data using empirical quantiles.
 * This method makes no distributional assumptions and directly uses the
 * observed distribution of returns.
 *
 * VaR is computed as the (1-α) quantile of the return distribution.
 * CVaR is computed as the average of all returns at or below the VaR level.
 *
 * @param returns Historical returns (n elements, typically sorted in ascending order internally)
 * @param n Number of historical observations (must be > 0)
 * @param confidence Confidence level (must be in (0, 1), typically 0.95 or 0.99)
 * @param var Output: Value at Risk (negative indicates loss)
 * @param cvar Output: Conditional Value at Risk (negative indicates loss)
 * @return 0 on success
 *         -1 if returns, var, or cvar is NULL
 *         -2 if n == 0
 *         -3 if confidence is not in (0, 1)
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
 * Space complexity: O(n) for working copy of returns
 * Thread safety: Thread-safe (creates working copy of input)
 *
 * @note The input returns array is not modified (a copy is sorted internally)
 * @note For small sample sizes, results may be sensitive to outliers
 * @note Requires sufficient historical data (typically n >= 250 for reliable estimates)

/**
 * @brief Calculate historical simulation VaR/CVaR for portfolio with weights
 *
 * Computes VaR and CVaR for a weighted portfolio given multi-asset return history.

 *
 * @param returns Asset return matrix (m × n, row-major: m assets × n time periods)
 * @param weights Portfolio weights (m elements, must sum to ~1.0)
 * @param m Number of assets
 * @param n Number of time periods

 *         -2 if m == 0 or n == 0
 *         -3 if confidence is not in (0, 1)
 *
 * Time complexity: O(mn + n log n)
 * Space complexity: O(n) for portfolio returns
 * Thread safety: Thread-safe
 *
 * @note Performance: 500 assets × 1000 periods in < 10ms on modern x86_64
